## Vision Statment

The goal is to create a cross platform marketplace app for Calvin University students. There is
currently a Facebook group that allows students to post items they are selling, but there are
some major flaws with it: no clear way of indicating if items are still available, listings are
ordered by post date so some items get lost, no easy way to filter or search for items (because
people post pictures of books), can be difficult to tell the prices of items, and it limits users
to those who have Facebook. The initial focus of the app would be for textbooks as that is one of
the most common items found on free and for sale and one of the most relevant items to college
students. But we hope to be able to expand it to include other items like clothing, technology,
etc. The app would allow a user to easily filter and search for items in the marketplace. Once
they found an item they are interested in, the app would connect the two users to communicate
about purchasing the item (potentially using an in-app chat feature, but for the MVP using email).

We intend to build Calvin Marketplace using Flutter which will allow us to simultaneously develop
for Android and iOS. This would allow us to grow as developers by engaging with a newer technology
and  also reach a wider audience. We will also gain experience working with databases as the items
and users will need to be stored and accessed. We believe that this new implementation of a
marketplace will allow students an easy way of posting items they have for sale, search for items
they need, and connect sellers and potential buyers.
